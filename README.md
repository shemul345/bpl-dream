# Player Selection in Franchise Cricket

In franchise cricket, players are chosen through **Auction** or **Draft** systems.  
The **IPL** uses an **Auction**, where teams bid for players like in a marketplace.  
The **BPL** mostly uses a **Draft**, where teams pick players in a fixed order.  
Both methods ensure balance and excitement in team building.  
These events are highlights of modern cricket leagues and loved by fans.
